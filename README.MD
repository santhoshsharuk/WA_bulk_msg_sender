## 🛠️ How to Use

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Contact List

Open the `contacts.csv` file and add the contacts you wish to message. The file must have two columns: `Name` and `Number`.

> **IMPORTANT:** The phone number must include the country code but **without** any `+`, `-`, or spaces.

**Example `contacts.csv`:**
```csv
Name,Number
Shafeek,919360220928
Sharuk,918110960489
Maria,34600123123
```

#### Step 2: Customize Your Message

Open the `app.py` script and find the `MESSAGE_TEMPLATE` variable. Edit the text inside the quotes to create your desired message. The `{name}` placeholder will be automatically replaced with each contact's name from your CSV file.

**Example `MESSAGE_TEMPLATE` in `app.py`:**
```python
# Edit this line to change your message
MESSAGE_TEMPLATE = "Hello {name}, this is a friendly reminder about our meeting tomorrow! 👋"
```

#### Step 3: Run the Script

Execute the script from your terminal:
```bash
python app.py
```

-   **On your first run:** A Chrome window will open. You will be prompted in the terminal to **scan the WhatsApp QR code** with your phone. After scanning, press `Enter` in the terminal to continue.
-   **On subsequent runs:** The script will automatically use your saved session to log in. No QR scan needed!

The terminal will display the progress as each message is sent.

## 🤔 Troubleshooting & FAQ

-   **Error: `TimeoutException` or `NoSuchElementException`**
    -   This usually means the script couldn't find an element (like the send button) on the page in time.
    -   **Solution 1:** Check if the phone number in your CSV is valid and correctly formatted.
    -   **Solution 2:** Your internet might be slow. The script waits up to 20 seconds, but very slow connections could still cause issues.
    -   **Solution 3:** WhatsApp Web's interface may have been updated by Meta.

-   **Session Not Saving / I Have to Scan the QR Code Every Time**
    -   Ensure the script has permission to create and write to the `whatsapp-session` directory in the project folder.
    -   If issues persist, delete the `whatsapp-session` directory and run the script again to create a fresh session.
